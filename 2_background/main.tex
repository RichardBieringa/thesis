% Introduction
% - Did not exist 10 years ago
% - Why now

A decade ago, \gls{sm} technology did not exist, at least not in its current form. It is a by-product of the evolution in application architectures and the trends in cloud-native application design \cite{balalaie2016microservices}. The shift to service-based architectural styles became popular when the \gls{devops} movement gained traction and became standard in the industry \cite{microservices-trends} Although this shift improved the speed and agility of software development \cite{amaral2015performance} it came at the cost of additional operational complexity and overheads which \glspl{sm} try to solve. 


The remainder of this chapter introduces several concepts and related topics relevant to this thesis. The topics are introduced in a specific order, which paints a general picture of the evolution and progression of technologies in the landscape. First, we introduce the concept of container technologies and talk about the mass adoption caused by \gls{docker} (\cref{sec:bg-containers}). Secondly, we introduce the concept of \glspl{micro-service} as a natural evolution of the \gls{soa} architecture paradigm and how it is further enabled by the adoption of container technologies (\cref{sec:bg-microservices}). Furthermore, we introduce \gls{k8s}, the defacto standard in container orchestration and which problems it tries to solve (\cref{sec:bg-kubernetes}). Finally, we go into the details of \gls{sm} technology where we introduce the core characteristics that define such a system and what problems this additional layer of networking abstraction tries to solve (\cref{sec:bg-kubernetes}).
