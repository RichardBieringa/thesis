\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:background:related-work}

In this section, we discuss the identified related work in the field. The core work in this thesis is divided into three primary chapters, the systems survey (\cref{chap:survey}), the benchmark design (\cref{chap:system-design}), and the experimental evaluation (\cref{chap:experimental-evaluation}). For each of these chapters we introduce a section with related work from both academia and the industry.
