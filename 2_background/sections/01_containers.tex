% General introduction Container
A \gls{container} is a unit of executable software that is packaged with all of its dependencies\footnote{\url{https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container}}. By packaging everything in a single unit it makes it easy to run the application on different environments, from desktops and laptops to cloud environments. \Glspl{container} isolate software from their environment and ensure that it works uniformly on all devices regardless of operating systems used or the hardware powering it. 


% How it works
\Glspl{container} leverage a set of Linux technologies, such as \textit{cgroups}\footnote{\url{https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html}} and \textit{namespaces}\footnote{\url{https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.htm}}. The former is a mechanism to organize processes in hierarchical groups whose usage of various system resources can then be limited and monitored. The latter is a technology to wrap a system resource in an abstraction to make it appear to a process as if they had their own isolated instance of that resource. These combined with the fact that a container has a layered file system that contains the application code and operating system dependencies makes it so that it is a fast and lightweight unit of compute. 

A comparison with \glspl{vm} is commonly made because of their isolating properties and abstractions. However, a \gls{vm} is a software-based virtualization of an entire computer system, this includes the hardware and the entire operating system that runs on top of it. A \gls{container} on the other hand is an abstraction at the application level, where it is just another process living in user space. A comparison of the different deployment models can be seen in \cref{fig:vm-vs-container}.

% Docker 
\Gls{docker} was introduced in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013 \cite{pycon2013}. It jump started the revolution of \glspl{container} and was for many the first introduction to \gls{container} technologies. It was loved by developers for its portability and speed compared to traditional \gls{vm} deployments that were commonly used. Due to its immense popularity and praise, which it has managed to uphold according to recent surveys as conducted by stack overflow \cite{stack-overflow-survey-2021}, \gls{docker} became the de facto standard in \gls{container} technologies. The similarly named company decided in 2015 to establish an open-source initiative that governs \gls{container} related standards\footnote{\url{https://opencontainers.org/}}. Along with this they donated their container image specification format\footnote{\url{https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec}} to this initiative as an open-source contribution. With this image specification standard in place, others could develop compatible container runtimes which were able to run the container images produced by said specification.
