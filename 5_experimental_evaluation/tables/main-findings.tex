\midrule

MF1 \label{mf-1} &
Using a \gls{sm} can lead to a significant decrease in sustained throughput. &
\ref{exp:design:1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule
  
MF2 &
There is a significant variance in the amount of sustained throughput that \gls{sm} systems can handle. &
\ref{exp:design:1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule 
  
MF3 &
The network latency overhead caused by the proxy of Cilium is minimal. &
\ref{exp:design:1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule  
  
MF4 &
The latencies observed from Istio under load have a large spread, and especially suffer in their tail end. &
\ref{exp:design:1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule    
  
MF5 &
Traefik mesh performs an order of magnitude worse than any other evaluated service mesh in terms of request latencies when the system is under full load. &
\ref{exp:design:1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule  
  
MF6 &
Traefik experiences bottlenecking behaviour under a load of approximately 500 requests per second resulting in a bimodal distribution of request latencies. &
\ref{exp:design:2} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:02} \\
\midrule  
  
MF7 &
There can be a significant difference in the amount of CPU utilization for different \gls{sm} systems under similar levels of load. &
\ref{exp:design:2} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:02} \\
\midrule  
  
MF8 &
The memory footprint of data plane proxies is negligible and does not significantly increase under higher levels of throughput. &
\ref{exp:design:2} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:02} \\
\midrule  
  
MF9 &
The size of the application payload does not have a significant effect on the performance of data plane proxies and resource utilization levels. &
\ref{exp:design:3} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:03} \\
\midrule  
  
MF10 &
The configuration using Traefik was unable to process any gRPC based requests. &
\ref{exp:design:4} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:04} \\
\midrule  
  
MF11 &
Both gRPC and HTTP-based workloads experience similar reductions in terms of sustained throughput. &
\ref{exp:design:4} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:04} \\
