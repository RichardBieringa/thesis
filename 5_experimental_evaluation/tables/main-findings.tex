\multicolumn{4}{c}{\textbf{Main Findings}} \\
\midrule

\textbf{MF1} &
Using a \gls{sm} can lead to a significant decrease in sustained throughput. &
\textbf{EXP 1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule
  
\textbf{MF2} &
There is significant variance in the amount of sustained throughput that \gls{sm} systems can handle. &
\textbf{EXP 1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule 
  
\textbf{MF3} &
The network latency overhead caused by the proxy of Cilium is lowest among all evaluated service mesh systems. &
\textbf{EXP 1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule  
  
\textbf{MF4} &
The latencies observed from Istio under load have a large spread, and are worse at the tail end. &
\textbf{EXP 1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule    
  
\textbf{MF5} &
Traefik mesh performs an order of magnitude worse than any other evaluated service mesh in terms of request latencies when the system is under full load. &
\textbf{EXP 1} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:01} \\
\midrule  
  
\textbf{MF6} &
Traefik experiences bottlenecking behaviour under a load of approximately 500 requests per second resulting in a bimodal distribution of request latencies. &
\textbf{EXP 2} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:02} \\
\midrule  
  
\textbf{MF7} &
There can be a significant difference in the amount of CPU utilization for different \gls{sm} systems under similar levels of load. &
\textbf{EXP 2} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:02} \\
\midrule  
  
\textbf{MF8} &
The memory footprint of data plane proxies is negligible and does not significantly increase under higher levels of throughput. &
\textbf{EXP 2} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:02} \\
\midrule  
  
\textbf{MF9} &
The size of the application payload does not have a significant effect on the performance of data-plane proxies on resource utilization levels. &
\textbf{EXP 3} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:03} \\
\midrule  
  
\textbf{MF10} &
The configuration using Traefik was unable to process any gRPC based requests. &
\textbf{EXP 4} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:04} \\
\midrule  
  
\textbf{MF11} &
Both gRPC and HTTP-based workloads experience similar reductions in terms of sustained throughput. &
\textbf{EXP 4} &
\cref{sec:experiments:results:per-experiment:04} \\
