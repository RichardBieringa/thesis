\chapter{Experimental Evaluation of Service Mesh systems}
\label{chap:experimental-evaluation}

% Introduction
% - What will this chapter contain and what resaarch question it tries to answer

% Prev chapter -> Design of the benchmark and implementation
% This chapter -> Design of experiments, conducting of experiments and results
In the previous chapter (\cref{chap:system-design}), we defined the \gls{sut} and the metrics that are important to evaluate the performance aspects of \gls{sm} systems. With this in mind, we designed and implemented a tool to benchmark the \gls{sut}. In this chapter, we present the experimental evaluation of \gls{sm} systems using the aforementioned benchmark. With this, we provide an answer to research question \ref{rq-3}. \textit{What are the differences between the different \gls{sm} systems in terms of overhead, throughput and latency?} 


% Rest of the chapter is structured as follows
% - Experimental Setup
% - Experimental Results
% - Analysis/Discussion
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. First, in \cref{sec:experiments:design} we introduce the design of the experimental setup. After that, in \cref{sec:experiments:results} we present and explain how to interpret the obtained results. Finally, in \cref{sec:experiments:discussion} we discuss the results and their implications.
