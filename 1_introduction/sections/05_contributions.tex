\section{Main Contributions}
\label{sec:introduction:contributions}

This thesis introduces several qualitative, quantitative and technical contributions that assist in answering the formulated research questions. Each contribution is linked to a main research question. The contributions are as follows:


% Emphasize why these concepts are challenging
% What is the usefulness of the results?
% Software Product -> Artifact
% Experiments -> Artifact

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (\textit{Conceptual}, \ref{rq-1}) A qualitative systems survey on the characteristics of state-of-the-art \gls{sm} systems \cref{chap:survey}.
    
    \item (\textit{Conceptual}, \ref{rq-1}) Extensive analysis on the design and architectural approach of state-of-the-art \gls{sm} systems \cref{chap:survey}.    
    
    \item (\textit{Conceptual}, \ref{rq-2}) Requirements analysis and design of a \gls{sm} benchmarking instrument  \cref{chap:system-design}.  
    
    \item (\textit{Technical}, \ref{rq-2}) Prototype implementation  of the designed benchmarking instrument, \textit{Mesh Bench} \cref{chap:system-design}.

    \item (\textit{Experimental}, \ref{rq-3}) Design and deployment of performance oriented experiments that evaluate \gls{sm} systems under various environments \cref{chap:experimental-evaluation}.
    
    \item (\textit{Experimental}, \ref{rq-3}) Quantitative performance results and extensive analysis of \gls{sm} systems \cref{chap:experimental-evaluation}.
