\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

The \gls{sm} architecture is an emerging approach to address several challenges presented in distributed systems. Through a dedicated layer of networking infrastructure it manages to improve the infrastructure in four areas of interest; observability, reliability, security, and programmability. In the latter half of the past decade, many \gls{sm} systems have surfaced, and have reached serious levels of adoption. Although performance is a crucial aspect for many, little is known about the performance implications of these systems. In this work, we address this shortcoming by taking an experimental approach to the emerging type of system, the \gls{sm}.
