\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion:future-work}

In this work, we present an experimental approach to analyse the performance of \gls{sm} systems. In a field that has previously received insufficient attention from academia, we present an extensive evaluation on a rapidly changing environment. During this work, however, we were only able to provide an answer to a limited amount of related questions and problems. Additionally, such an emerging field with many ongoing developments poses a wide range of many interesting research questions and points.

Based on the results from our work and the current challenges present in the field, we suggest the following opportunities for future research:
