\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:survey:summary}

To conclude the systems survey, we return to the initial research question (\ref{rq-1}), \textit{How do existing \gls{sm} implementations compare?}. The answer to this question is provided in various levels of detail throughout the systems survey. The most detailed and objective answer is provided  within the data synthesis and results section (\cref{sec:survey:results}) in which we identified domain-specific characteristics and features and compared the systems based on that. A summarized result is presented in the form of established functional and non-functional requirements (\cref{sec:survey:analysis}), in which we combine results from the data synthesis to provide a more generic, but more useful result. Finally, in \cref{sec:survey:analysis:architectures}, we take a deep-dive into the architectural differences of identified systems in which we answer the research question by exploring key characteristics in more detail.

Throughout this systems survey, we observed that \gls{sm} systems can have different approaches and goals and that systems within this the area are constantly changing. With many of the systems adopting different strategies and bleeding-edge technologies, the area is exciting in many ways.
